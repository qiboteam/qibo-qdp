Quantum PDFs
------------

Qibo provides a variational circuit model for parton distribution functions,
named qPDF. This model is based on :class:`qibo.models.Circuit` and provides a
simple API to evaluate PDF flavours at specific values of the momentum fraction
x. Further details and references about this model are presented in the
``examples/qPDF`` tutorial.
